abstract = {The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted regulations requiring wireless communication service providers to provide position location (PL) information for a user requesting E-911 service. The Time Di erence of Arrival (TDOA) technique is one of the most promising position location techniques for cellular-type wireless communication systems. The IS-95 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system is a popular choice for the companies deploying new cellular and PCS systems in North America. Hence, the feasibility of TDOA techniques in CDMA systems is an important issue for position location in the wireless systems of the future. This thesis analyzes the performance of TDOA techniques in the CDMA systems. A comparison and assessment of di erent algorithms for nding the time di erence estimates and for solving the hyperbolic equations generated by those estimates has been made. This research also considers a measure of accuracy for TDOA position location method which is shown to be more suitable for CDMA systems and more closely matches to the FCC requirements. Among the other contributions is a proposed method to perform cross-correlations to identify only the desired user's TDOA in a multiuser environment. This thesis also evaluates the feasibility and accuracy of TDOA techniques under varying system conditions that might be encountered in real situations. This includes varying conditions of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Multiple Access Interference (MAI), power control and loading. The e ect of the mobile position and of di erent arrangement of base stations on TDOA accuracy is also studied. Performance comparison in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels is made. The feasibility of using increased power levels for the 911 user in combination with interference cancellation is also studied. The e ect of using a single stage of parallel interference cancellation at neighboring cell sites has also been explored. Non-ideal situations such as imperfect power control in CDMA operation has also been investigated in the context of position location. This thesis also suggests a method to correct TDOA estimation errors in CDMA. It is shown that this improvement can give greatly improved performance even under worst-case situations. Performance comparison of results with and without that modi cation has also been made under various conditions.},

abstract = {—Connectivity is probably the most basic building block of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Up to know, the two main approaches to provide data access to the things have been based either on multi-hop mesh networks using short-range communication technologies in the unlicensed spectrum, or on long-range, legacy cellular technologies, mainly 2G/GSM, operating in the corresponding licensed frequency bands. Re-cently, these reference models have been challenged by a new type of wireless connectivity, characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands, used to realize access networks with star topology which are referred to a Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). In this paper, we introduce this new approach to provide connectivity in the IoT scenario, discussing its advantages over the established paradigms in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and architectural design, in particular for the typical Smart Cities applications.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything—including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history. Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge, and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important. Already, IoT projects are under way that promise to close the gap between poor and rich, improve distribution of the world's resources to those who need them most, and help us understand our planet so we can be more proactive and less reactive. Even so, several barriers exist that threaten to slow IoT development, including the transition to IPv6, having a common set of standards, and developing energy sources for millions—even billions—of minute sensors. However, as businesses, governments, standards bodies, and academia work together to solve these challenges, IoT will continue to progress. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to educate you in plain and simple terms so you can be well versed in IoT and understand its potential to change everything we know to be true today.},

abstract = {Accurate acoustic source localization at a low sampling rate (less than 10 kHz) is still a challenging problem for small portable systems, especially for a multitasking micro-embedded system. A modification of the generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method with the up-sampling (US) theory is proposed and defined as the US-GCC method, which can improve the accuracy of the time delay of arrival (TDOA) and source location at a low sampling rate. In this work, through the US operation, an input signal with a certain sampling rate can be converted into another signal with a higher frequency. Furthermore, the optimal interpolation factor for the US operation is derived according to localization computation time and the standard deviation (SD) of target location estimations. On the one hand, simulation results show that absolute errors of the source locations based on the US-GCC method with an interpolation factor of 15 are approximately from 1/15- to 1/12-times those based on the GCC method, when the initial same sampling rates of both methods are 8 kHz. On the other hand, a simple and small portable passive acoustic source localization platform composed of a five-element cross microphone array has been designed and set up in this paper. The experiments on the established platform, which accurately locates a three-dimensional (3D) near-field target at a low sampling rate demonstrate that the proposed method is workable.},

Among the enormous approaches of TDOA, high resolution TDOA algorithms have drawn much attention for its ability to resolve closely spaced signal delays in multipath environment. However, the state-of-art high resolution TDOA algorithms still have performance weakness on resolving time delays in a wireless channel with dense multipath effect. In this paper, we propose a novel TDOA algorithm with super resolution based on a multi-dimensional cross-correlation func-tion: the Volume Cross-Correlation Function (VCC).

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {Location based services (LBS) provided by wireless sensor networks have garnered a great deal of attention from researchers and developers in recent years. Chirp spread spectrum (CSS) signaling formatting with time difference of arrival (TDOA) ranging technology is an effective LBS technique in regards to positioning accuracy, cost, and power consumption. The design and implementation of the location engine and location management based on TDOA location algorithms were the focus of this study; as the core of the system, the location engine was designed as a series of location algorithms and smoothing algorithms. To enhance the location accuracy, a Kalman filter algorithm and moving weighted average technique were respectively applied to smooth the TDOA range measurements and location results, which are calculated by the cooperation of a Kalman TDOA algorithm and a Taylor TDOA algorithm. The location management server, the information center of the system, was designed with Data Server and Mclient. To evaluate the performance of the location algorithms and the stability of the system software, we used a Nanotron nanoLOC Development Kit 3.0 to conduct indoor and outdoor location experiments. The results indicated that the location system runs stably with high accuracy at absolute error below 0.6 m.},

abstract = {-This article introduces chirp spread spectrum technology (CSS for short) and optimized location algorithm. Symmetric double-sided two way ranging technique (SDS– TWR for short) is applied to improve accuracy and range of measurement. Linear frequency modulation ranging technology utilizes protocols combining CSMA / CA and TDMA, and adjusts dynamically transmission rate and frame length according to noise, interference and multipath to ensure optimal throughput and accurate distance information. System has anti-jamming capability and covers great distance.},
